 Cheque clearing lifecycle
</h1>
<p class="ghq-card-content__paragraph" data-ghq-card-content-type="paragraph">
 When a cheque is presented for payment, the bank verifies the authenticity of the cheque and the availability of funds. This verification process is known as check clearing. It ensures that the cheque is not fraudulent and that the account has sufficient funds for payment.
</p>
<p class="ghq-card-content__paragraph" data-ghq-card-content-type="paragraph">
 The check clearing process involves several stages. Firstly, the cheque is physically presented to the drawee bank. The bank examines the cheque for any irregularities or alterations. It also checks the signature and verifies that the necessary security features are present.
</p>
<p class="ghq-card-content__paragraph" data-ghq-card-content-type="paragraph">
 Once the bank completes these checks, it debits the funds from the drawer's account and credits them to the payee's account. This transfer of funds usually takes a few days to complete.
