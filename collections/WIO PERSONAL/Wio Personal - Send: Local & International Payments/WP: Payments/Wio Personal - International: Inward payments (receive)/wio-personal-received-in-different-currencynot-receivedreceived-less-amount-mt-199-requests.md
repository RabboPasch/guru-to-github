It is sent internally between banks and cannot be requested by customers. In this article you will learn about received in different currency/not received/received less amount / MT 199 requests.

   Sometimes, sender banks convert the payment to AED before sending it to Wio. Wio does not perform any conversion if the payment currency matches the currency of the beneficiary account. Customers should contact the sender for more details on the conversion.

   International payments can take around 3 business days. If the payment is not received after this period, customers should share a copy of the SWIFT payment, including the UETR number, with Wio. The sender can provide this copy.

   Wio does not charge fees on incoming fund transfers. However, the sender may have selected charge codes such as 'BEN' (charges borne by the beneficiary) or 'SHA' (charges shared between sender and beneficiary), leading to deductions by the sender’s bank or intermediary banks. Additionally, the sender’s bank or intermediary bank might have converted the amount from foreign currency to AED at a poor conversion rate.
  </li>
 </ul>
</ol>
<p class="ghq-card-content__paragraph" data-ghq-card-content-type="paragraph">
 For all these scenarios, if there is a need for an MT 199 request, customers should contact the beneficiary bank to send an MT 199 request to Wio.
